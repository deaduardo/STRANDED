# STRANDED - a text-based adventure game

STRANDED is a narrative text-based game that features the Butterfly Effect: every decision you make in the game has its consequence and will dictate your outcome/ending. 

Synopsis: your younger brother wakes up on a stranded island due to a stupid mistake. As you are on the phone with him, you must guide him through making a number of decisions to prolong your brother's life, until he is spotted and rescued. 

As my first full-fledged program, I am proud of how tidy and logical my code is with the use of functions to avoid redundancy. Hard-code dialogues however was the only way I know how to incoporate the narrative into the game. 
Some things to add/improve: 
+ A game save functionality for each of the days (day 1, day 2, day 3).
+ Use of more functions to avoid even more code redundancy
+ Polish the dialogues to build a more *believable* narrative

Written in Python.
