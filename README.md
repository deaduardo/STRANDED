# STRANDED - a text-based adventure game

STRANDED is a narrative text-based game that features the Butterfly Effect: every decision you make in the game has its consequence and will dictate your outcome/ending. 
As my first full-fledged program, I am proud of how tidy and logical my code is with the use of functions to avoid redundancy. Hard-code dialogues however was the only way I know how to incoporate the narrative into the game. 
Some things to add/improve: 
+ a game save functionality for each of the days (day 1, day 2, day 3).
+ use of more functions to avoid even more code redundancy
+ Polish the dialogues to build a more *believable* narrative

Written in Python.
